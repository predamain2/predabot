# Discord Bot Error Fixes - Summary

## Issues Fixed

### 1. **View Timeout Configuration Issues**
**Problem:** DraftView was configured with `timeout=None` causing internal Discord.py scheduling conflicts.
**Solution:**
- Changed DraftView timeout from `None` to `900.0` (15 minutes)
- Created `SafeView` base class with proper timeout handling
- Added cleanup callbacks for view lifecycle management

### 2. **Interaction Response Conflicts**
**Problem:** Multiple attempts to respond to the same interaction, expired interactions, and unsafe response handling.
**Solution:**
- Created `InteractionSafety` utility class with safe response methods
- Added `safe_respond()`, `safe_defer()`, and `safe_edit_message()` methods
- Implemented interaction expiration checks and response state validation
- Added interaction-specific locking to prevent concurrent responses

### 3. **Rate Limiting Issues**
**Problem:** Bot making too many API calls causing 429 errors and performance degradation.
**Solution:**
- Implemented rate limiting protection in `InteractionSafety._rate_limit_check()`
- Added API call tracking with 4 calls per second limit per guild
- Automatic delay insertion when approaching rate limits

### 4. **Memory Leaks and Callback Issues**
**Problem:** Dynamic callback attachment causing memory leaks and orphaned references.
**Solution:**
- Created `SafeSelect` and `SafeButton` components with proper callback handling
- Replaced dynamic callback assignment with class-based approach
- Added proper component cleanup in view rebuilding

### 5. **Error Handling and Logging**
**Problem:** Insufficient error handling causing crashes and poor user experience.
**Solution:**
- Created comprehensive `BotErrorHandler` class
- Added global error handlers for commands and app commands
- Integrated with existing error logging system
- Added periodic cleanup tasks for stale data

## Files Created/Modified

### New Files:
1. **`interaction_utils.py`** - Safe interaction handling utilities
2. **`bot_error_handler.py`** - Global error handling system
3. **`FIXES_SUMMARY.md`** - This summary document

### Modified Files:
1. **`main.py`** - Updated all View classes, interaction callbacks, and message editing calls

## Key Changes in main.py

### View Classes Updated:
- `DraftView` → `SafeView` with 15-minute timeout
- `RegisterView` → `SafeView` 
- `HostInfoView` → `SafeView`
- `SubmitResultsView` → `SafeView`
- All inline View classes → `SafeView`

### Interaction Handling:
- All `interaction.response.send_message()` → `InteractionSafety.safe_respond()`
- All `interaction.response.defer()` → `InteractionSafety.safe_defer()`
- All `msg.edit()` → `InteractionSafety.safe_edit_message()`
- Added `@safe_interaction` decorator to all callback methods

### Component Management:
- `Select` components → `SafeSelect` with proper callback handling
- Improved component lifecycle management in `build_select()`
- Added cleanup callbacks for view timeout handling

## Benefits of These Fixes

1. **Eliminated "Unknown Interaction" Errors**
   - Proper interaction expiration checking
   - Safe response handling with fallbacks

2. **Resolved Rate Limiting Issues**
   - Automatic rate limiting protection
   - Reduced API call frequency during high activity

3. **Fixed View Timeout Problems**
   - Proper timeout configuration
   - Graceful timeout handling with user feedback

4. **Improved Memory Management**
   - Eliminated callback memory leaks
   - Automatic cleanup of stale data

5. **Enhanced Error Recovery**
   - Comprehensive error logging
   - Graceful degradation when errors occur
   - Better user experience with informative error messages

6. **Increased Bot Stability**
   - Reduced crashes and unexpected behavior
   - Better handling of edge cases and concurrent operations

## Usage Notes

- The bot now automatically handles interaction timeouts and errors
- Rate limiting is transparent to users but protects against Discord API limits
- All view components have proper cleanup and error handling
- Error logs are comprehensive and help with debugging

## Testing Recommendations

1. Test draft picking with multiple concurrent users
2. Verify timeout handling by waiting 15+ minutes on draft views
3. Check error messages appear properly when issues occur
4. Monitor rate limiting during high activity periods
5. Verify no memory leaks during extended operation

The bot should now be significantly more stable and handle the previously identified error patterns gracefully.
